Meeting Time: Mondays and Wednesday at 4:40 - 7:30 PM in ARTANX103 (the Mac Lab)

Final Examination Period: Friday, June 7th at 1:00-3:00 PM

## Course Description
This course studies game platforms and their effect on development, design, the player, and the public. The domains of the class will be focused around video games including their design, development, and production while exploring platforms and their contexts through a holistic perspective  Through developing a set of games in and for the Pico-8 platform, students will further their technical skills in procedural literacy, content and asset creation, development of gameplay systems, and problem solving in digital media. Alongside technical development, production methods (e.g. game design documents, team software development methodology, playtesting, etc.) will be required. Finally, students will communicate their games to the outside world through pitches, open play testing sessions, press kits, and making their game accessible on the internet.

## Materials

A copy of [Pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) (provided by CDM).  
One of the [Platform Studies Series](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/series/platform-studies) of books depending on your workgroup (purchased by student).

### Game 1

The initial game project serves as an initial foray into Pico-8 development. The emphasis will be on making a playable prototype based on game pitch in small teams.

### Game 2

The second game project is most impactful activity in the course. In teams, students will work through a standard indie development cycle from pitch to beta. This includes concept pitches, game design documents, prototypes, alphas, betas, gameplay testing, critiques, demos, presentations, and code reviews. This project necessitates a significant commitment of time and engagement. The resulting beta versions of the games will be held to a high standard of qualtiy among serveral dimension including art, visual design, user interface, gameplay, and rhetoric.

### Platform Studies Presentation

Every students will work in a team to give a long-format presentation over one of the books in the MIT Platform Studies series. To do this, every member of the team must read the subject book and work as a team to give an presentation that communicates the main themes and inferences of their book. These groups will be formed in class and assigned a book to purchase, read, and present over.

## Attendance Policy
This course has no formal attendance policy. However, regular attendance is greatly recommended to be successful in the course as many of the class meetings will involve programming and one-on-one learning. If you expect to be consistently absent, please discussion the situation with your instructor.

If you choose to use a device with a screen, please sit in the back of the room to avoid distracting your fellow students. You are required to ask for permission before video or audio recording in the classroom. In general, students will be treated as adults capable of managing their technological lives while being respectful of others in the classroom.

If permission is granted, personal use and sharing of recordings and any electronic copies of course materials (e.g., PowerPoints, formulas, lecture notes and any classroom discussions online or otherwise) is limited to the personal use of students registered in the course and for educational purposes only, even after the end of the course.

To supplement the classroom experience, lectures may be audio or video recorded by faculty and made available to students registered for this class. Faculty may record classroom lectures or discussions for pedagogical use, future student reference, or to meet the accommodation needs of students with a documented disability. These recordings are limited to personal use and may not be distributed (fileshare), sold, or posted on social media outlets without the written permission of faculty.  

Unauthorized downloading, file sharing, distribution of any part of a recorded lecture or course materials. or using information for purpose other than the student's own learning is prohibited unless prior authorization is given by the instructor.
