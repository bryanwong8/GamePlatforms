# Game Pitch Information

## What is a Game Pitch?

Game pitches come in a few formats: 1 sentence, 30 second, 2 minute, and ~10 minute visual presentations. 
The goal of a game pitch is to communicate the novel, exciting, and desirable aspects of your game design vision to particular audience.
Often, these audiences are producers, funders, juries, or some other people who are looking to find the best of many pitches.

## Key Features of a Good Pitch

* Is it novel?
* Is there an audience?
* Is it feasible?
* Do you have a team capable of completing a project?
